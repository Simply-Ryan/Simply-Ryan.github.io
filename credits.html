                <p>I firstly would like to credit myself for managing to keep up with my school studies and not letting this affect my marks all while learning what I like personally. I believe that I've done a nice job for someone my age at keeping the balance right. I can hopefully become a software engineer or game developer one day!</p>

                <p>C++ is the first programming language I wanted to learn seriously, and The Cherno's C++ playlist on YouTube really helped me understand everything I know currently.</p>
                <li class="bullet_point bold"><a class="bold" href="https://www.youtube.com/@cs50">Harvard University</a></li>
                <p>This credits is specific to their online course "CS50x" available online for completely free where they teach computer science from scratch (literally).</p>

                <p>GothamChess' entertaining content has helped me keep a passion for the game of chess when I was getting frustrated at my loss streaks.</p>

                <p>He has very educational content in contrast to the most popular chess youtubers. I believe he deserves more merit as he taught me that the basics are applicable at a much higher level than one may think.</p>
